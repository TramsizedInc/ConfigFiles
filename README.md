# ConfigFiles

My setup for a WM called spectrwm with it's own bar 
My fish setup
Some ascii art for the fish

The baraction.sh has some dependencies, all of them are listed inside of the file
To use that, you might have to make it executable (chmod +x)
The bar is compatible with alsa, pulse and you can make it do more,
but there is a catch! The "echo -e" command has some limitations regarding string size 
All dependencies can be installed on arch but I personaly have never tried it on 
anything else, other than arch, so good luck if you do so

I don't care what you do with the files sell them, give them away or trade it for 
some kidney, no copyright is applied. I'd be flattered if you'd name me as an author...
